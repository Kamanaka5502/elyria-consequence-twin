## ◈ Position

Elyria Consequence Twin is a **full-stack consequence-governance runtime and commercial product scaffold** for consequence-bearing systems. It models whether a proposed movement may become operationally real before execution binds.

This is not just a proof artifact. It is a runnable product surface with dashboard intake, API assessment, deterministic admission logic, structured evidence gating, signed receipts, local storage, replay verification, exposure graphing, and proof packet export.

It asks the stricter operational question:

> Can this action become real right now, under valid authority, active standing, sufficient evidence, preserved custody, refusal logic, signed receipt, and replayable proof?

## ◈ Current Claim

```text
Elyria Consequence Twin is a full-stack consequence-admission runtime and buyer-facing product scaffold within Elyria's universal consequence-governance architecture.
```

The architecture layer is universal. The public repo claim is bounded.

This repository exposes the reviewable product/demo layer of the Consequence Twin. It does **not** expose protected Elyria / Veritas internals, claim substrate status, or claim production certification without security and customer-specific review.

## ◈ Runtime Status

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Full-stack dashboard | present |
| API assessment path | present |
| Deterministic admission engine | present |
| Structured evidence gate | enforcement-bearing |
| Signed receipt envelope | present |
| Replay verification | present |
| SQLite receipt storage | present |
| Current exposure graph | present |
| Proof packet export | present |
| Reviewer test path | present |
| Production claim | production-oriented / not certified |

## ◈ Runtime Path

A reviewer can run the stack locally and inspect a complete consequence-control path:

```text
movement intake
→ authority / standing / evidence / custody checks
→ evidence gate logic
→ deterministic verdict
→ signed receipt
→ SQLite receipt storage
→ replay verification
→ current exposure graph
→ proof packet export
```

The runtime classifies movement into four operational verdicts:

| Verdict | Color | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `ADMIT` | green | movement may bind consequence |
| `HOLD` | yellow | proof is incomplete or evidence needs correction |
| `REFUSE` | red | movement is blocked by refusal, invalid authority, or inactive standing |
| `NO_PROVABLE_ADMISSION` | black | movement is attempting to become real without durable proof |

The black path is the executive risk surface. It exposes movement that may otherwise bind without sufficient proof.

## ◈ Full-Stack Guts

| Layer | Files | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Interface | `apps/api/static/index.html` | dashboard, token panel, movement intake, evidence editor, receipts, replay, proof export |
| API | `apps/api/main.py` | FastAPI endpoints for assessment, receipts, replay, exposure graph, proof packet, sandbox reset |
| Admission Engine | `src/consequence_twin/engine.py` | deterministic verdict selection: `ADMIT`, `HOLD`, `REFUSE`, `NO_PROVABLE_ADMISSION` |
| Evidence Gate | `src/consequence_twin/evidence.py` | structured evidence summary and enforcement-bearing evidence status |
| Receipts | `src/consequence_twin/receipt_runtime.py` | signed receipt envelope, input hash, evidence summary, replay basis |
| Storage | `src/consequence_twin/storage.py` | local SQLite receipt persistence and retrieval |
| Graph | `src/consequence_twin/graph.py` | consequence exposure graph from demo or stored receipt-backed movements |
| Auth | `src/consequence_twin/auth.py` | client-mode bearer-token protection for protected endpoints |
| Tests | `tests/` | engine, API, auth, storage, evidence, receipt replay, dashboard surface, full-stack path |
| Docs | `docs/`, root review files | buyer readout, claim boundary, reviewer quickstart, proof/demo path, limitations |

## ◈ v0.8 Evidence Gate Logic

Structured evidence is now enforcement-bearing when present.

Evidence is not decorative metadata. It can control the verdict.

Rules:

```text
accepted required evidence → ADMIT remains available
missing required evidence → NO_PROVABLE_ADMISSION when authority and standing could otherwise bind
insufficient required evidence → HOLD
missing custody owner → HOLD
missing hash/reference → HOLD
unsupported evidence status → HOLD
```

This prevents a movement from claiming clean admission while its structured evidence record contradicts that claim.

## ◈ Signed Receipt and Replay Basis

Each assessed movement emits a receipt containing:

```text
receipt_id
movement_id
verdict
color
reasons
timestamp_utc
input_hash
engine_version
original_input
evidence_summary
signature_algorithm
signature
```

Replay verifies:

```text
input_hash_matches
verdict_matches
signature_matches
evidence_summary_matches
```

## ◈ Demo-Ready Runtime Path

Run locally:

```bash
cd elyria-consequence-twin
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest tests
uvicorn apps.api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

Expected reviewer result:

```text
RESULT: PASS
Dashboard loads.
Movement can be submitted.
Evidence can be attached.
Signed receipt is emitted.
Replay verifies.
Current graph updates.
Proof packet exports.
```

## ◈ Client Mode

Client mode protects receipt, replay, proof export, sandbox reset, current graph, and movement-assessment endpoints behind a bearer token.

```bash
export ELYRIA_MODE=client
export ELYRIA_API_TOKEN="replace-with-local-demo-token"
export ELYRIA_RECEIPT_SIGNING_SECRET="replace-with-local-signing-secret"
uvicorn apps.api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Browser flow:

Preset Accepted Evidence
Submit Movement + Emit Receipt
Preset Black Path
Submit Movement + Emit Receipt

## ◈ Production Posture

This repo is **demo-ready and production-oriented**, not production-certified.

Production deployment requires:

```text
security review
secret management
enterprise authentication and authorization
customer-specific policy mapping
customer-specific evidence mapping
logging and retention review
deployment hardening
key-management review
legal/compliance review where applicable
operational acceptance testing
```

Correct production boundary:

```text
Full-stack consequence runtime, not production certification.
Universal architecture layer, bounded public repo claim.
