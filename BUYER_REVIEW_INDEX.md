# Buyer Review Index

## Purpose

This is the top-level review map for Elyria Admission Runtime.

It points a buyer, reviewer, recruiter, technical evaluator, or implementation partner to the current public proof surface without overstating deployment status.

## Current Classification

```text
Implementation: complete across Phases 1-4
Verification: pending CI and fresh-clone evidence
Public posture: bounded buyer-review runtime candidate
Production deployment: subject to customer review and external review where required
```

## One-Command Verification

From repository root:

```bash
python scripts/verify_all.py
```

With report output:

```bash
python scripts/verify_all.py --report verification-report.json
```

Expected final marker:

```text
RESULT: ELYRIA ADMISSION RUNTIME FULL VERIFY PASS
```

## Open Tracking Issues

| Issue | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `#2` | Phase 1 enterprise hardening foundation |
| `#3` | Phase 2 consequence proof layer |
| `#4` | Phase 3 external verifier and review bundle |
| `#5` | Phase 4 production boundary and CI proof gates |
| `#6` | final A+ verification evidence gate |

## Buyer-Review Claim Boundary

Safe current wording:

```text
Elyria Admission Runtime is a bounded buyer-review consequence-admission runtime candidate with implemented proof-gate layers across access control, tenant boundary, signed receipt review, audit-chain review, policy-pack mapping, no-bind proof, route closure, changed-condition replay, external verifier review, digest verification, and production preflight review mode.
```

Final A+ wording should wait until CI and fresh-clone evidence are recorded in the final verification gate.
